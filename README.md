## bash_scripts

### **Hey, viewer!**
### Welcome to my bash repo

#### Here, you will see a lot of .sh files. These are the scripts I have written while learning bash scripting

#### They might not neccessarily look complex or lengthy, but they are baby steps

#### I am open to corrections, improvement and collaboration on any bash project
